I worked in this project of making a university management system with my colleagues. I uploaded two files :


1. A report explaining the project from scratch including the following topics : business requirements for the project,  ERD, Relational Schema , explanation of the sql implementation, and finally a simple user friendly GUI that helps user navigate and manage the data and tables

2. The SQL code file
